## 📖 About the Project  
The **BlockDot E-Commerce Website** is a project I developed during my college years as part of our web development coursework.

This project challenged me to apply my skills in **front-end development** while also exploring how to structure a simple yet functional online store. It was one of my first experiences creating a real-world inspired project and helped me understand the fundamentals of designing and coding an e-commerce website.
